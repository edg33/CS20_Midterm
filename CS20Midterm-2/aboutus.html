        <p> <strong>Our Story:</strong><br>Nestled in the heart of our city, Zesty's was born from a dream to share the wonders of Italian cuisine with our community. Our founders, Mario and Lucia, both hailing from the picturesque regions of Tuscany and Sicily, brought with them a deep love for the culinary traditions of their homeland. 

            In 2010, Zesty's opened its doors, inviting guests to savor the authentic flavors of Italy in a cozy and elegant setting. Our menu, inspired by the diverse regions of Italy, features a range of dishes from hearty pastas to exquisite seafood, all prepared with the freshest ingredients and a touch of creativity.
            
            Join us at Zesty's, where every meal is a journey to the heart of Italy.</p>
